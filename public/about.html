<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr>
<p>My name is Savina Ivanova and i use the nickname sisssona across the social medias. I am a web developer to be...
   I had interests in Unity, where i started my track. After that i chose to study C#, of course and the journey began.
   Now i have finished Fundamentals Module, C# Advanced, C# OOP and have some knowledges in JS Front-End but i still continue 
   studying because i wish to become a full stack developer and to work for some interesting real projects. I have
    a long way ahead and i won't stop here.</p>

<p>I hope that i will attach some more jobs really soon here!</p>
